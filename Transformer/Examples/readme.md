Trax is an end-to-end library for deep learning that focuses on clear code and speed. It is actively used and maintained in the Google Brain team. This notebook (run it in colab) shows how to use Trax and where you can find more information.

1.Run a pre-trained Transformer: create a translator in a few lines of code
2.Features and resources: API docs, where to talk to us, how to open an issue and more
3.Walkthrough: how Trax works, how to make new models and train on your own data
